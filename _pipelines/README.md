## Nasqueron Datasources :: pipelines

The dags/ directory contains DAGs pipelines as code for Apache Airflow.

Those pipelines can be used:

   - at Nasqueron, on our Airflow instance
   - elsewhere, as a sample documentation how to use our datasources
     components and how to glue the components together

The nasqueron_datasources module is published to the dags folder too,
so is available from the different DAGs. It contains helper methods.

Unit tests are available in tests/ folder.
